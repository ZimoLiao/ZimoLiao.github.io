I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Modern Mechanics at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I have a broad interest in fluid physics (especially turbulence) and related interdisciplinary approaches.

About Turbulence
======

Turbulence (turbulent flows), usually referred to as the most important unsolved problem in classical physics (by Richard Feynman), is ubiquitous in natural and engineering processes - from the water flow in a small faucet to the atmospheric turbulence enveloping the planets. As a fascinating subject in various senses, "turbulence" is associated with a lot of great personalities in fluid physics and mathematics - O. Reynolds, L. Prandtl, von Karman, G.I. Taylor, A.N. Kolmogorov - and appears in many great pieces of art such as Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts, The Great Wave off Kanagawa and The Starry Night of Van Gogh.

Yet, formidable challenges go with the beauty of turbulent flows: nonlinearity, multi-scale nature, and irregularity, just to name a few. As said by Guy Beart, 

> Turbulence toiler, on the rack,  
> For each step forward, two steps back!

By now, we still don't fully understand where turbulence comes from (the transition between laminar and turbulent states) and where it goes (toward somewhat ultimate scaling?).
Scientists have been working hard on this problem for decades, flaring sparks on the boundless ocean to guide the later generations. And now, it's our turn to continue this voyage.
