> Nothing happens in vain, but everything from reason and by necessity - Leucippus (c. 460 BC)

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Modern Mechanics at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I have a broad interest in fluid dynamics (especially turbulence) and related interdisciplinary approaches.

Turbulence (turbulent flows), usually referred to as the most important unsolved problem in classical physics (by Richard Feynman), is ubiquitous in natural and engineering processes - from the water flow in a small faucet to the atmospheric turbulence enveloping the planets. As a fascinating subject in various senses, "turbulence" is associated with a lot of great personalities in fluid physics and mathematics - O. Reynolds, L. Prandtl, von Karman, G.I. Taylor, A.N. Kolmogorov - and appears in many great pieces of art such as Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts, The Great Wave off Kanagawa and The Starry Night of Van Gogh.

Yet, formidable challenges go with the beauty of turbulent flows: nonlinearity, multi-scale nature, irregularity, just to name a few. As said by Guy Beart, 

> Turbulence toiler, on the rack,  
> For each steap forward, two steps back!

Though turbulence research is paved with adversities, it is still worth fighting for.
