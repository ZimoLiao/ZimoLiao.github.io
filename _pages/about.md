I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Modern Mechanics at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I have a broad interest in fluid dynamics (especially turbulence) and related interdisciplinary approaches.

Turbulence, usually referred to as the most important unsolved problem in classical physics (by Richard Feynman), is ubiquitous in natural and engineering processes - from the water flow in a small faucet to the atmospheric turbulence enveloping the planets. As a fascinating subject in various senses, "turbulence" is associated with a lot of great personalities in fluid physics and mathematics - O. Reynolds, L. Prandtl, von Karman, G.I. Taylor, A.N. Kolmogorov - and appears in many great pieces of art such as Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts, The Great Wave off Kanagawa and The Starry Night of Van Gogh.
