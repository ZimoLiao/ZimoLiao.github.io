excerpt: 'A novel modal analysis method named RVMD is proposed, inspired by the Hilbert-Huang transform and variational mode decomposition, to extract coherent structures in fluid flows. The combination of RVMD and Hilbert spectral analysis leads to a modal-based time-frequency analysis framework in the Hilbert view, providing a potentially powerful tool to discover, quantify, and analyse the low-order dynamics featured by transient and/or nonstationary properties in complex flow problems.'
